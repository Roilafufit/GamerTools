# GamerTools
A social Discord bot created for the Discord Hack Week competition.

### Features
Coming soon.

### Technical Information
The bot was coded in Python 3.6 using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) package, version 0.16.12. [![discord.py version 0.16.12 on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/discord.py/0.16.12.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/0.16.12/)

The bot might work in other Python versions, however, I did not test that.

It's important that the version of the discord.py package will be 0.16.12, newer versions have major changes that I'm not familliar enough with. (This is why I used version 0.16.12 although it's outdated)
